        <h1>So What is HTML?</h1>
        <p>
            HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements,
            which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a
            certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words,
            can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.
        </p>
        <h1>Anatomy of an HTML element</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 50px">The main parts of our element are as follows:<br>
            <b>The opening tag:</b> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and
            closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where
            the paragraph begins.<br>
            <b>The closing tag: </b>This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before
            the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add
            a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.<br>
            <b>The content:</b> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.<br>
            <b>The element:</b> The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.<br>
        </p>
